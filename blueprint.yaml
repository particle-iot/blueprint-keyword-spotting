  The Keyword Spotting tutorial is reference project to identify the keywords "Yes" and "No" in audio data received from a PDM microphone.

  This solution is designed for Particle devices like the Photon 2, Boron, and M-SoM.
  
description: |
  The keyword spotting tutorial detects keywords spoken into a microphone, using Edge Impulse's machine learning capabilities.

  This solution is designed to be deployed on Particle devices, such as the Photon 2, Boron, and M-SoM, and works with sensors to monitor and classify audio patterns in real-time. The default model detects "Yes" and "No," but you can train it for any desired keywords using Edge Impulse.

  Key Features:
  - Utilizes Edge Impulseâ€™s machine learning platform to develop a responsive, customizable keyword-spotting model
  - Supports seamless deployment on Particle hardware, enabling real-time edge processing
  - Designed for new users and developers to quickly test, adapt, and expand their IoT solutions
